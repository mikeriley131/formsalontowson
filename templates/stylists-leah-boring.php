					<p>Leah always had a love for people, hair and fashion. While beginning her 5th year in retail marketing, Leah realized that she needed to make her real passion a career. After studying at the acclaimed Studio 1612 Salon in Mt Washington as an apprentice, she worked as a stylist there for 6 years and her love grew immensely with her fast growing clientele. In 2012, Leah shifted gears to a smaller-scaled salon at All About Me in Towson where she worked for one year until her twin girls were born in 2013. She took a hiatus to be home with the babies but kept her hand in hair with a small list of clients always knowing she would officially return to a salon when the time was right. Coming full circle, Leah is returning to work, not only at a place that best fits her drive and personality, but she will be working for and along side some of her old mentors and fellow stylists. Her enthusiasm is infectious and she is eager to build up her book again! She has a broad knowledge of coloring and highlighting, and shows strength in short edgy cuts, and she is continuing her education focusing on the latest trends. She has the ability to connect with her clients and make you feel comfortable in her chair, and keep you coming back! </p>
