					<p>As a stylist of over 14 years, Lauren prides herself on the relationships she builds with each and every client. Creating individualized looks through dimensional color and personalized hair shaping is the foundation of her work. Lauren enjoys formulating the perfect shade of blonde and using dry cutting techniques to create movement in the hair. She also has a passion for education, completing advanced education with TIGI, Paul Mitchell, and other industry leaders, as well as spending several years as an educator for Studio 1612's apprenticeship program. Lauren also loves her role as a wedding day stylist. Nothing makes her happier than creating unique and stunning hair and makeup looks for her bridal clients. Lauren is looking forward to this next chapter in her career as a hairstylist, makeup artist, and co-owner of Form Salon.</p>
