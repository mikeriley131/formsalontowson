					<p>Erika's inspiration and passion for the industry has been with her throughout her life&mdash;her mother a former hair stylist, and a favorite childhood game called "makeover time", and even doing makeup for her high school's theater department--she has always known that a career in the beauty industry would suit her well. She started out as a makeup artist for MAC Cosmetics and then moved on to a freelance position by starting her own company, "Glam on the Go." She then decided to further her skills and attend Robert Paul Academy of Arts in 2011. Since then, she has soaked up every aspect of hair styling and even attended a variety of furthering education and advanced technique classes. She loves creating beautiful blondes, bombshell brunettes, and vivid fashion colors. Her favorite aspect of the industry is the constant change and versatility it offers. She enjoys determining what will look best on each individual client and educating them on products and styling techniques, so that they can create the same fabulous look at home every day.</p>
