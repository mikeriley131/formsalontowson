					<p>Lindsey has been working her magic at Form since December of 2016. She has achieved an incredible following for her balayage and blonding. There really is nothing she can not do with a paintbrush and a curling iron. Creating waves is one of her favorite ways to bring out the dimension in her color work. Her talent doesn't end there, her shining personality and her cutting skills have earned her a loyal following from men's to long layered cuts. Beyond cutting and coloring, Lindsey is your go to for make up artistry. Whether it's an event or an everyday look you are going for, Lindsey is your girl. She is a true talent and we are so happy to have Lindsey on the Form team!</p>
