					<p>Becky's effervescent personality and love of working with a diverse clientele has launched her into a successful career as a stylist with nearly nine years of experience. She enjoys working with clients to learn how she can renew confidence and bring a modern, fresh style to their everyday lives. She thoroughly enjoys every aspect of the hair industry, and her “can-do” attitude leaves a lasting impression on everyone. She is also passionate about education-- initially learning coloring techniques under Framesi educator Tracy Mackenzie, and then moving on to more advanced skills and knowledge from Wella, Paul Mitchell, and Aveda. Becky believes ongoing education is the key to a thriving career, and is inspired by classic and modern approaches to hair cutting, coloring, and styling for men and women.</p>
