					<h1>Caroline DeLauder</h1>
					<p>Caroline has been in the salon industry for 16 years, 11 of them as a stylist at Studio 1612, one of the top salons in Baltimore frequently featured in Baltimore Magazine's Best Salon issue. After graduating from Notre Dame Prep she completed her graphic design degree at Towson University. She then decided her talents were better suited as a hairstylist. She has trained extensively under many masters in the industry from TIGI, Wella, Paul Mitchell, Framesi and more and taken that knowledge to become an educator at Studio 1612. She takes great pride in creating styles through texture and color specifically for each client and enjoys educating them on how to recreate their look at home. She also specializes in wedding and formal event styles with some of her work being featured in the Baltimore Sun, Jewish Times and local fashion shows. Caroline is passionate about her career as a hairstylist and her new role as co-owner at Form Salon.</p>
